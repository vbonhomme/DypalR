DypalR
======

(Experimental) functions to operate Dypal in console mode from R. 

Used in the simulations for the paper entitled "Configurational changes of patchy landscape dynamics: a case study in a tropical biodiversity hotspot" by Bonhomme et al. (submitted).

This code is probably not generic enough to be used with other Dypal model than the so-called Aoupini√© model,
but do not hesitate to contact me should you need to use Dypal in console/batch mode.
